# BM25 Search Engine with Paraphrasing

This project implements a BM25-based search engine enhanced with paraphrasing capabilities. Users can upload documents, search for relevant content using the BM25 ranking algorithm, and receive paraphrased answers generated by a transformer-based language model.

## How It Works

1. **Document Upload**: Users upload `.txt` or `.pdf` files to build a searchable document corpus.
2. **Preprocessing**: Uploaded files are tokenized, cleaned, and processed (e.g., stopwords removed).
3. **BM25 Ranking**: When a query is submitted, documents are ranked by their relevance using the BM25 algorithm.
4. **Paraphrasing**: Relevant document sections are passed to a paraphrasing model (GPT 4) to generate reworded answers.
5. **Results Display**: Both the matched sections and paraphrased response are displayed in the user interface.

## Features

- **Document Upload**: Supports `.txt` and `.pdf` files to populate the corpus.
- **BM25 Search**: Retrieves and ranks relevant sections using the BM25 algorithm.
- **Paraphrasing**: Uses transformer-based models to generate paraphrased responses.
- **Interactive UI**: Displays uploaded files, search results, and paraphrased answers in a clean interface.

## Libraries and Requirements

### Python Libraries:

- **Flask** – Web framework for the UI
- **PDFPlumber** – Extracts text from PDFs
- **NLTK** – Tokenization, stopword removal, and other NLP utilities
- **Transformers** – Access to models like gpt 4 api for paraphrasing
- **Requirements.txt** – More libraries found in requirements.txt

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://https://github.com/B3z3rk/Intelle-X.git
cd Intelle-X
```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**Activate the Environment**

- On Windows:
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Download NLTK Data by adding to app.py**

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

## Running the Project in VS Code

1. **Open the Folder**  
   Open the `Intellex` folder in VS Code.

2. **Select the Virtual Environment**  
   Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS), select **Python: Select Interpreter**, and choose your `.venv`.

3. **Run the Flask App**  
   Open the terminal and run:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Usage

1. **Upload Documents**  
   Click "Choose File" to upload `.txt` or `.pdf` files, then click "Upload".

2. **Search**  
   Enter your query (e.g., _“What is a tree?”_) and click "Search".

3. **View Results**

- **Matching Sections**: Relevant content from uploaded documents.
- **Paraphrased Response**: A reworded response based on your query and results.

4. **Select Specific Documents**  
   Use checkboxes in the **Sources** panel to limit your search to selected documents.

5. **Select Specific Documents to delete**  
   Use checkboxes in the **Sources** panel to delete uploaded selected documents.

6. **Menu**  
   Use **Menu** panel to see menu options.
