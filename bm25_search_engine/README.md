Explanation of the Code
Initialization:

The BM25 class takes a corpus (list of documents) and two tuning parameters: k1 and b.

It computes the length of each document and the average document length (avgdl).

Preprocessing:

The _preprocess_corpus method computes:

Term Frequency (TF): How often each term appears in each document.

Document Frequency (DF): How many documents contain each term.

Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): A measure of how rare a term is across the corpus.

BM25 Score Calculation:

The _compute_bm25_score method calculates the BM25 score for a query and a specific document using the BM25 formula.

Ranking Documents:

The rank_documents method computes the BM25 score for each document in the corpus and ranks them based on their scores.

Customization
You can adjust the k1 and b parameters to fine-tune the algorithm for your specific use case.

Add preprocessing steps like stopword removal or stemming if needed.
